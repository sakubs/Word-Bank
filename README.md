Word Bank
=========

Overview

## Description
This is a simple Android app for making word bank drag and drop style worksheet games.

I am using it for my English tutoring hobby in Japan. The idea is for it to be flexible and robust 
enough that I can use it for different types of grammar checks for different levels.

## Requirement
I developed this app with Android Studio, you may use what you like.

Only an Android or virtual device is necessary.

## Usage

Install the APK on your device and run the app as any other app.
